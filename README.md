# SitSatSat üåü

This project explores the use of **Quantum Annealing** to solve the classic **3SAT** problem. The aim is to maximize the number of satisfied clauses in a given **Boolean formula** using **D-Wave's quantum annealer** (via their Ocean SDK) and **SimulatedAnnealingSampler** for optimization.

üéØ **Project Goal**: Solve 3SAT instances with quantum annealing techniques to optimize the truth assignments that maximize the number of satisfied clauses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites:
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- Required libraries: `dimod`, `dwave-ocean-sdk`

### Installation Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-annealing-3SAT.git
    cd quantum-annealing-3SAT
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install dimod
    pip install dwave-ocean-sdk
    ```

3. **Create a D-Wave Account**:
   - Go to [D-Wave Leap](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/) and sign up.
   - Obtain your **API token** from the D-Wave console.

4. **Set Up Your API Token**:
    ```bash
    export DWAVE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
    ```

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Prepare the 3SAT Formula:
- **Input Format**: Represent the Boolean formula in a standard form (e.g., `(x1 OR x2 OR NOT x3) AND (NOT x1 OR x3 OR x4)`).

### Running the Code:
1. Navigate to the project folder in the terminal.
2. Run the main script to solve the 3SAT problem:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The output will include:
    - The optimal binary assignments for the variables.
    - The total number of satisfied clauses.
    - Visualization results (optional).

## üîç How It Works

### Problem Transformation:
1. Convert the **3SAT problem** to a **QUBO model**.
2. Define a **quadratic objective function** based on the Boolean formula.
3. Assign a binary variable for each clause in the formula.

### Quantum Annealing Optimization:
- **Optimization Goal**: Find the assignment of binary variables that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses.
- **Quantum Annealing** is used to explore the solution space and search for an optimal solution.

### Classical vs. Quantum Optimization:
- While classical methods involve exhaustive search, quantum annealing uses probabilistic techniques for faster exploration of the solution space.
